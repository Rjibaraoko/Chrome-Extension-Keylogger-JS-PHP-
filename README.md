# Chrome-Extension-Keylogger-JS-PHP

In this project I want to try to make a "malware" that would record all of the keystrokes of a victim on their computer. By trying this out I would be able to better understand how a potential attacker could make a tool combined with a vulnerability to steal intel on a user.

I decided to make it into a Chrome extension because I found it would be a interesting way of infiltrating the computer of a user with a fake add-on. 

I made 4 files. 2 Javascript files. One for the background to communicate with the server and that would make the action possible of registrating the keystrokes. 2 others for the json manifest file and the file that would be added to a server (local in this instance) to be able to gather those keystrokes in a automatic generated file.
